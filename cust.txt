Normalization:
All the tables seem to be in Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) since all tables have only one candidate key, and each non-key attribute is functionally dependent on the primary key. Also, there are no partial dependencies, i.e., no non-key attributes are dependent on only a part of the primary key.

However, there is one potential issue with the "Orders" table. The "Method_Of_Payment" and "Order_Staus" columns have check constraints that limit their values to a predefined set of options. While this helps to ensure data integrity, it is not strictly related to the table's functional dependencies. Therefore, to be in BCNF, these columns should be moved to a separate table and referenced by a foreign key in the "Orders" table. This will eliminate the possibility of redundant data and improve the maintainability of the database schema.

Dependencies:

- Customer:
  - Customer_ID -> Customer_Name
  - Customer_ID -> Date_of_Birth
  - Customer_ID -> Customer_Password
  - Customer_ID -> Date_of_Signup
  - Customer_ID -> Date_of_Last_Purchase
  - Customer_ID -> Customer_Status

- Inventory:
  - Product_ID -> Product_Name
  - Product_ID -> Cost_Price
  - Product_ID -> Prod_Type
  - Product_ID -> Manufacture_Date
  - Product_ID -> Expiry_Date

- Customer_Address:
  - Address_ID -> Customer_Address
  - Address_ID -> Customer_Pincode

- Warehouse_Address:
  - Warehouse_ID -> Warehouse_Address
  - Warehouse_ID -> Warehouse_PinCode

- Lives_in:
  - (Customer_ID, Address_ID) -> Contact

- Located_in:
  - (Warehouse_ID, Product_ID) -> Quantity

- Orders:
  - Transaction_ID -> Transaction_Date
  - Transaction_ID -> Transaction_Time
  - Transaction_ID -> Quantity_of_Sale
  - Transaction_ID -> Selling_Price
  - Transaction_ID -> Final_Cost
